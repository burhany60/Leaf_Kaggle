    "\n",
    "There are around 1/2 million species of plants in the world. Using images of plants to identify species be useful for a variety of reasons: crop and food supply management, plant based research, species population tracking. In this project I will use Convolutional Neural Networks to classify grey-scale images to identify each image as one of 99 leaf species. These models will either incorporate multiple convolutional layers as well as merging the features extracted by the convolutions with a pre-extracted feature set (provided by Kaggle) of each leaf image. Each model will be evaluated by minimizing the loss function, log-loss. The best of my Neural Networks earned a log-loss of 0.02312 on Kaggle's test data set, which translates to 100% accuracy on predicting a leaf's species from its corresponding image."

    "In this project, 4 CNNs were tested in their ability to correctly label an image of a leaf. The results show that for this image set convolutions learn the edges of the leaf's image to identify which species the leaf is. Furthermore, the Kaggle provided numerical data proved to be very predictive of the leaf species, and when combined with the feature engineering of the CNNs the models were able to label the images with great certainty. Deep Learning often suggests that domain knowledge is as important as a proper neural network structure, however, Kaggle's provided data was extracted using a scientist's expertise in leaves. Not only does this project provide evidence that CNNs cam be used to label images with great precision, but, that domain knowledge can go a long way in increasing a model's accuracy."
